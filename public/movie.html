<h3>Fried Green Tomatoes</h3>
<p>Fried Green Tomatoes also has an intelligent and heart-warming story, strong direction and some charming, 
    funny and touching dialogue as well. The ending was suitably uplifting, but I admit I did shed a tear, mostly because 
    I was so impressed by how beautiful the film was. Also superb is the acting.</p>

<h3>Twister</h3>
<p>Twister, one of the most successful movies of the 90's, mainly due to it's special effects and a lot of people's want 
    for a natural disaster movie that is fun to watch, this was an extremely popular movie.</p>

<h3>Marley & Me</h3>
<p>About a dog and is a heartwarming romantic comedy that tugs at the audience's emotions with its blend of humor, love, 
    and the inevitable trials of life.</p>
